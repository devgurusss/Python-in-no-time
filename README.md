# Python Programming 101: A Comprehensive Introduction

Welcome to the "Python Programming 101" series! This repository contains Jupyter notebooks accompanying a 3-video series aimed at introducing Python programming with a focus on detailed technicalities. Whether you're a complete beginner or looking to solidify your understanding of Python, this series will guide you through the fundamental concepts, best practices, and core functionalities of the language.

## Series Overview

This series is structured into three videos, each progressively building on the previous one to provide a comprehensive introduction to Python:

### **Video 1: Introduction to Python and Basic Syntax**
   - **Topics Covered:**
     - Overview of Python and its applications
     - Installing Python and setting up the development environment
     - Understanding basic syntax, variables, and data types
     - Writing and running your first Python program
   - **Jupyter Notebook:** `01_introduction_to_python.ipynb`
   - **Learning Objectives:**
     - Get familiar with the Python programming environment
     - Learn how to write and execute basic Python code
     - Understand how to use variables and different data types

### **Video 2: Control Flow and Data Structures**
   - **Topics Covered:**
     - Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `elif`)
     - Loops (`for`, `while`)
     - Introduction to Python data structures (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries)
     - Iterating over data structures and understanding their use cases
   - **Jupyter Notebook:** `02_control_flow_and_data_structures.ipynb`
   - **Learning Objectives:**
     - Learn to control the flow of your program using conditional statements and loops
     - Get a solid understanding of Python's built-in data structures
     - Practice iterating and manipulating data using loops and data structures

### **Video 3: Functions, Modules, and Best Practices**
   - **Topics Covered:**
     - Defining and calling functions in Python
     - Understanding scope and return values
     - Working with Python modules and the standard library
     - Introduction to Python best practices and coding conventions
   - **Jupyter Notebook:** `03_functions_modules_best_practices.ipynb`
   - **Learning Objectives:**
     - Understand how to write reusable code using functions
     - Learn to organize code into modules and use the Python standard library
     - Adopt best practices for writing clean, readable, and efficient Python code
